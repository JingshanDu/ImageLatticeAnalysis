# ImageLatticeAnalysis
This tool segments an image usindg a periodic 2D parallelogram mesh and stack them together for further analysis. An example use is to segment a lattice image into individual unit cells. Note: one axis of the lattice is always horizontal. Rotate original image before processindg when necessary.
